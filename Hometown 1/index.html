        <h2>Discover the History</h2>
        <p>
            Rome, the Eternal City, has over 2,500 years of history! Founded in 753 BCE by the legendary twins Romulus and Remus, 
            it started as a kingdom before becoming a powerful Republic in 509 BCE. Rome expanded its influence across the Mediterranean 
            after the Punic Wars.</p>
         <p>
            In 27 BCE, it became an Empire under Augustus Caesar, kicking off the Pax Romana – a golden age of peace and iconic landmarks 
            like the Colosseum and Pantheon. Though the Western Roman Empire fell in 476 CE, the Eastern half (Byzantine Empire) thrived.
         </p>   
        <p>
            During the Renaissance, Rome became an artistic and cultural hub, home to masterpieces by Michelangelo. Today, it’s a vibrant 
            blend of ancient history and modern life, enchanting visitors from around the world!
